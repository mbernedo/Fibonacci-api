1) Install dependencies (yarn install o npm install)
2) Turn on service using yarn dev
3) Test it localhost:4000?index=10 (Index is the position in the fibonacci serie)

Technical decisions:

- Usings a for loop to create the fibonacci serie having the index as a parameter
- Create the api rest service as get
- Using MVC architecture for easy development


Future optimizations:

- Saving the fibonacci series in cach√© and updating if the index is greater than the used before for time optimization
